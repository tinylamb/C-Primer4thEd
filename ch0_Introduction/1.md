###Tips

> Since the concepts from each section tend to build on those from previous sections, it is a good idea to ensure you roughly understand each section before you move on.

* For example, books will omit sections on programming style, common pitfalls, debugging, good/bad programming practices, and testing.

* Provide a lot of examples.

* Provide practice programs.

* Most importantly: have fun.
