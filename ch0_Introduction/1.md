###Tips

> Since the concepts from each section tend to build on those from previous sections, it is a good idea to ensure you roughly understand each section before you move on.

* For example, books will omit sections on programming style, common pitfalls, debugging, good/bad programming practices, and testing.

* Provide a lot of examples.

* Provide practice programs.

* Most importantly: have fun. 

> The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as ¡°trust the programmer¡± -- which is both wonderful, because the compiler will not stand in your way if you try to do something unorthodox that makes sense, but also dangerous, because the compiler will not stand in your way if you try to do something that could produce unexpected results.
